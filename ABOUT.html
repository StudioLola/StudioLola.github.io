                STUDIO LOLA features the work of Lola Giuffré … jeweller, artist and mechanical engineer.
                <br><br>
                The studio’s work represents Lola’s unique combination of creative and technical skills, along with her passion for invention, collaboration and problem solving.
                <br><br>
                From an early age Lola has been enthusiastic about art making. In 2004, at the age of 9, she reached a notable milestone on her creative journey by treating the people of Sydney to a daisy chain unlike any they’d seen before. Read more about that fun and formative project HERE.
                <br><br>
                In her high school years Lola the aspiring artist developed a complementary interest in mathematics and physics. So, she went on to study science and engineering at The University of Melbourne, earning a subsequent Masters Degree in Science, Majoring in Precision and Microsystems Engineering from Delft University of Technology.
                <br><br>
                After graduating from TU Delft in 2018, Lola interned as a Design Engineer at Studio Roosegaarde in Rotterdam, and from 2019 until early 2024 worked full time as an R&D mechanical engineer and ultimately the Head of Research & Development at Delft-based Flexous, a company specialising in flexible mechanism technology and silicon micro-fabrication.
                <br><br>
                In parallel to her work as a mechanical engineer, Lola has been designing and making custom jewellery for a variety of clients located around the world, while at the same time undertaking part time studies in goldsmithing at Vakschool Schoonhoven in The Netherlands.
                <br><br>
                STUDIO LOLA is based in Rotterdam where Lola lives with her partner Gijs van der Velden.
